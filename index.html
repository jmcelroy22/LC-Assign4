                <p>
                    This was my first time traveling to Europe. I was alone, excited and antiminated. The flight was long and tiring,
                    but as soon as I stepped off the plan a rush of excitement came over me. I caught my train to my hostel and and as soon
                    as I stepped up on level ground I felt as if I was in a different world or back in time. The architecture was 
                    stunning and people flooded the narrow streets all around. I was exhausted but I couldn't wait to start exploring. I walked 
                    for miles taking in everything I saw. The beautiful language of people conversating in cafes, the markets flooded with 
                    art and merchandise, the history of the buildings still being lived in, the music of local musciains playing on the streets. 
                    I was on a high and could have continued all day and night but I decided to check in and get some rest. This was a random solo trip 
                    just to see the world. In my hostel I got to meet other travlers along with some locals that I still keep in touch with today. 
                    With fresh produce from the local market we cooked dinners together in the hostel, listen to music, and shared stories of our 
                    travels.
