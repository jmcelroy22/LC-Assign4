                <h2>
                    Madrid, Spain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time traveling to Europe. I was alone, excited and antiminated. The flight was long and tiring,
                    but as soon as I stepped off the plan a rush of excitement came over me. I caught my train to my hostel and and as soon
                    as I stepped up on level ground I felt as if I was in a different world or back in time. The architecture was 
                    stunning and people flooded the narrow streets all around. I was exhausted but I couldn't wait to start exploring. I walked 
                    for miles taking in everything I saw. The beautiful language of people conversating in cafes, the markets flooded with 
                    art and merchandise, the history of the buildings still being lived in, the music of local musciains playing on the streets. 
                    I was on a high and could have continued all day and night but I decided to check in and get some rest. This was a random solo trip 
                    just to see the world. In my hostel I got to meet other travlers along with some locals that I still keep in touch with today. 
                    With fresh produce from the local market we cooked dinners together in the hostel, listen to music, and shared stories of our 
                    travels.

                <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
                <p>
                    After spending some time in Madrid I headed to the coast of Spain to see all things 
                    Gaudi. Barcelona was very different from Madrid. I was surronded by a much younger crowd looking to
                    party and tourist, but wanted to see all things Gaudi. He has been one of my favorite artist since 
                    I studied him in my high school art class. After checking in to my hostel I set out to see all
                    of his work. I did a tour of his home, museums, and park. The park was my favorite with acres of 
                    art.

                <h3>Porto, Portugal</h3>
                <p>
                    After Barcelona I decided to head to the oposite coast to see Porto, Portugal. I wanted to get away
                    from the busy cities flooded with tourist. I decided to get lost in the mountains of northern Portugal. 
                    I took the train from Barcelona to Porto and found a great Hostel on the edge of town. I strolled the streets
                    along the beach till my bus was ready to take me up in the mountains. I found a tiny village in the mountains of the 
                    national park Gerdes. I stayed in a little cabin surrounded by green mountains, waterfalls, still lakes and 
                    wild horses.

                    <h4>Lisbon, Portugal</h4>
                    <p>
                        I traveled south down the coast of Portugal to my next stop in Lisbon. I found a beautiful up in the mountains 
                        called Sintra. Sintra is famed for it's beauty, midevil castles, scenic beaches, parks and gardens. Tucked away in the mountains
                        is this beautiful village famous for it's 19th-century Romanticist architecture. The history and beauty of this village was remarkable. 
                        I felt as if I had traveled back in time walking through gardens and castles that date back to the early 15th-century.

                <h5>Florence, Italy</h5>
                <p>
                    This was my second trip back to Europe. I had completely fallen in love with the people, art, architecture and culture my first time
                    and I had to go back. This trip was more of a work trip than a trip to explore, however I did get to see all of Tuscany, and the rolling
                    hills Tuscany did not disappoint. This was a trip all about food and wine. I arrived in Florence early on a rainy Tuesday to be picked up
                    by a fellow employee of the restaurant I was set to start working in that week. I got settled in my apartment, took a nap and set out to 
                    get to know this beautiful city. I walked through the narrow streets that opened to plazas filled with cafes, markets and towering cathedrals.
                    I was set to open an Italian restaurant/pizzeria back home and wanted to learn all things food the Italian way. I attended classes everyday
                    at the pizza academy in Florence then I was employed at their restaurant Zero Zero. I worked with the best group of people and learned a lot about
                    Italian cuisene. We worked long hard hours and rewarded ourselves with late nights out filled with wine and music.
